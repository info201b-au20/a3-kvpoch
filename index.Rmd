## Introduction
United States is the most incarcerated country in the world due to the significant
contribution of systemic racism. For example, the prison system reveals to target
individuals of color through over-policing and the war on drugs, leading to the disproportionate incarceration of people of color. Through this assignment, I am examining the patterns of inequality
using the incarceration data collected by the [Vera Institute](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends).
